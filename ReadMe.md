# Advent of Code 2021

This year I'm attempting the challenges in python using jupyter notebooks

## Day 1: Sonar Sweep
Nothing too special here, just a for loop and a simple comparison.

My sliding frame implementation is very lazy :D

⭐⭐

## Day 2: Dive!
I thought it would be nicer to read the puzzle data directly from the url, but I dont know how to do that authentication in python's urllib, so I'll leave that and just get on with the puzzle.

Again nothing too special in my code here, but it's nice to be able to use tuples.
